## Fronted using React framework and Backend FastAPI- MongoDB.




## Deployment
Here you will see the two folders:

Backend: Here I have tried to connect the database with the help of FastAPI and MongoDB.

Final: Here I have tried to create a front with the help of the React Framework.


1: Clone the Project

2: Simply install package

I am trying to build this app using FASTAPI for the backend server, React for the frontend client,
and MongoDB for the backend database server.

Thank you.
